open tasks:

- convenience make() methods and other pretty stuff
- implement scheduled executors (and queues, if needed)
- implement some form of central dispatch
- find a nice interface for futures and implement it
- convert the former queue-demo to testworks as appropriate
- should executors offer integrated profiling/stats of some sort?
